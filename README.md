# Rule-Based Chatbot (Python)


Overview
This project is a rule-based chatbot built with Python that uses keyword matching and message probability calculations to generate responses. The chatbot can engage in basic conversations, respond to various user inputs, and handle common topics like greetings, movies, music, and more. The chatbot is also capable of handling unrecognized queries through fallback responses, improving interaction flow.

Features
Rule-based keyword matching for generating contextually relevant responses.
Message probability system that determines the best response based on user input.
Predefined responses for multiple topics, including:
Greetings (morning, afternoon, evening)
Movies and TV shows
Music recommendations
Book suggestions
Fallback mechanism to handle unrecognized or unclear inputs.
Technologies Used
Python: Core logic for keyword matching and response generation.
Regular Expressions (re): Used to split and parse user input.
